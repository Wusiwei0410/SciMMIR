## SciMMIR

This is the repo for the paper [SciMMIR]().

In this paper, we propose a novel SciMMIR benchmark and a corresponding dataset designed to address the gap in evaluating multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) models in the scientific domain.

It is worth metion that we define a data hierarchical architecture of "Two subsets, Five subcategories" and a use the human created key words to classify the data (as shown in ![Tab](./imgs/data_architecture.png)).



## Dataset & Codes

Our SciMMIR benchmark dataset used in this paper contain 537K scientific image-text paris which are extracted from the latest 6 months' papers in Arxiv (2023.05 to 2023.10), and we will continue to expand this data by extracting data from more papers in Arxiv and provide larger versions of the dataset.

We will relase the Dataset and codes soonly ...

## SciMMIR

This is the repo for the paper [SciMMIRï¼š Benchmarking Scientific Multi-modal Information Retrieval]().

In this paper, we propose a novel SciMMIR benchmark and a corresponding dataset designed to address the gap in evaluating multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) models in the scientific domain.

It is worth mentioning that we define a data hierarchical architecture of "Two subsets, Five subcategories" and use human-created keywords to classify the data (as shown in the table below).

As shown in the table below, we conducted extensive baselines (both fine-tuning and zero-shot) within various subsets and subcategories.

## Dataset & Codes

Our SciMMIR benchmark dataset used in this paper contains 537K scientific image-text pairs which are extracted from the latest 6 months' papers in Arxiv (2023.05 to 2023.10), and we will continue to expand this data by extracting data from more papers in Arxiv and provide larger versions of the dataset.

We will release the Dataset and codes soon...
